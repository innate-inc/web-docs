# Updating MARS

This page explains how to update the software running on your MARS robot using the `innate-update` command-line tool.

Updating MARS will:

- **Fetch the latest Innate OS version** for your robot.
- **Apply code and configuration changes** needed for that version.
- **Restart the robot software stack** so it runs the new version.

All of this is handled for you by `innate-update`.

---

## Prerequisites

- You can **SSH into your robot**. If WiFi isn't available, you can also [connect via the Jetson USB-C port](connecting-via-ssh.md#via-usb-c-jetson).
- The `innate-update` command is available on the robot.
- The robot has **internet access**.

If you are missing any of these, contact your admin or refer to the internal setup documentation.

:::tip
The MARS app will automatically indicate when an OS update is available, so you don't need to manually check for updates regularly.

## Basic workflow

On the robot, you use three subcommands:

- `innate-update status` – see what version you're on.
- `innate-update check` – see if updates are available and what will change.
- `innate-update apply` – actually install the update.

In normal use you'll run:

1. `innate-update check`
2. If updates are available, `innate-update apply`

---

## Check current version

Run:

```bash
innate-update status
```

You should see something like:

- A short **current version identifier** (for example, a short commit hash or version string).
- A message indicating that this is your current system version.

Use this when you want to confirm what version your robot is currently running.

---

## Check for updates

Run:

```bash
innate-update check
```

Typical outcomes:

- **System is up to date**
  - You'll see a message indicating that no updates are available.
  - You'll see the current version identifier.
- **Updates available**
  - You'll see a message that there are **new commits/changes available**.
  - You'll see both your current version and the latest version.
  - You'll see a short summary of recent changes that would be applied.
  - The command will tell you to run `innate-update apply` if you want to install them.

Use this before doing any serious work on the robot to ensure you're on the latest version.

## Apply updates

When `innate-update check` shows that updates are available, run:

```bash
innate-update apply
```

You can expect:

1. A header or banner indicating that the **update process** has started.
2. A summary of the changes that will be applied.
3. A confirmation prompt asking whether you want to continue.
4. Progress messages as the update is applied.
5. A final message indicating that the update **completed successfully**.

During the update:

- Some services and processes on the robot will be **temporarily stopped and restarted**.
- The robot may not be responsive to commands for a short period until the update finishes.

Once the command reports that the update is complete, MARS is running the new software version.

## What to do if something looks wrong

If `innate-update check` or `innate-update apply` fails or shows an error:

- Run the command again and read the error message carefully.
- If you cannot resolve it, share:
  - Which command you ran.
  - The error message shown in the terminal.

with your support channel or internal tooling, so they can help debug.

<summary>How do I find my MARS ID?</summary>

Your MARS ID is a unique number assigned to your robot. There are two ways to find it:

**Via Bluetooth**

When you turn on your robot and look for it in the Innate app's Bluetooth connections screen, the robot will appear with a name like **"MARS the 1st"**, **"MARS the 2nd"**, etc. The number in the name is your MARS ID.

For example:

- "MARS the 1st" → MARS ID **1**
- "MARS the 5th" → MARS ID **5**
- "MARS the 12th" → MARS ID **12**

**Via robot_info.json**

If you can SSH into your robot, you can also find the ID in the robot info file:

```bash
cat ~/innate-os-data/robot_info.json
```

Look for the `robot_id` field in the JSON output.

# Changing the Robot's Voice

MARS uses [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai/) for text-to-speech. You can customize the robot's voice by changing the Cartesia voice ID.

## Method 1: Using Environment Variables (Recommended)

The simplest way to change the voice is through the `.env` file. No rebuild required.

### Steps

1. SSH into your robot (see [connecting-via-ssh.md](connecting-via-ssh.md "mention"))

2. Edit the `.env` file:

```bash
nano ~/innate-os/.env
```

3. Add or modify the `CARTESIA_VOICE_ID` variable:

```bash
CARTESIA_VOICE_ID=your-voice-id-here
```

4. Save the file and restart the robot for changes to take effect.

## Method 2: Editing the Launch File (Advanced)

For more permanent changes, you can modify the launch file directly.

### 1. Find the launch file

The voice ID is configured in the brain client launch file:

```text
~/innate-os/ros2_ws/src/brain/brain_client/launch/brain_client.launch.py
```

### 2. Change the voice ID

Look for the `cartesia_voice_id_arg` parameter and update the `default_value`:

```python
cartesia_voice_id_arg = DeclareLaunchArgument(
    "cartesia_voice_id",
    default_value="9fdaae0b-f885-4813-b589-3c07cf9d5fea",  # Change this ID
    description="Cartesia Alfred voice id",
)
```

Replace the voice ID with your desired Cartesia voice ID.

### 3. Rebuild the workspace

Run the following command to recompile:

```bash
cd ~/innate-os/ros2_ws && colcon build
```

Wait until the build completes.

### 4. Restart the robot

Restart MARS for the changes to take effect.

## Finding Voice IDs

You can either:

- **Use an existing Cartesia voice** — Browse their voice library to find a voice ID that suits your needs
- **Create a custom voice** — Cartesia allows you to clone a voice with just 10 seconds of audio recording

Check out the [Cartesia documentation](https://docs.cartesia.ai/get-started/overview) to learn more about available voices and how to create your own.

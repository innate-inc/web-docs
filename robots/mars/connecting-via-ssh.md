# Connecting via SSH

This page explains how to connect to your MARS robot via SSH.

The default credentials are:

- **Username:** `jetson1`
- **Password:** `goodbot`

---

## Via WiFi

If your robot is connected to the same network as your computer, you can SSH into it using its hostname:

```bash
ssh jetson1@<robot-name>.local
```

### Finding your robot's hostname

The hostname is based on **your robot's name** (the one you set in the app). The name is automatically converted to a valid hostname:

- Letters become lowercase
- Spaces and special characters become hyphens (`-`)
- Multiple hyphens are collapsed into one
- Leading/trailing hyphens are removed

**Examples:**

| Robot Name | Hostname | SSH Command |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| `My Robot` | `my-robot.local` | `ssh jetson1@my-robot.local` |
| `MARS_01` | `mars-01.local` | `ssh jetson1@mars-01.local` |
| `Test Bot` | `test-bot.local` | `ssh jetson1@test-bot.local` |

If you haven't named your robot, the default hostname is `mars.local`:

```bash
ssh jetson1@mars.local
```

## Via Ethernet (Preferred Wired Method)

If you need a reliable wired connection, **Ethernet is the recommended approach**. Connect an Ethernet cable between your computer and the robot.

Once connected, SSH into the robot:

```bash
ssh jetson1@192.168.50.2
```

### Configuring your computer's Ethernet

You need to set a static IP on your computer's Ethernet interface. Choose your operating system:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
**Windows 10 / 11**

1. Right-click **Start** → Select **Network Connections**
2. Click **Advanced network settings** → **More network adapter options**
3. Right-click **Ethernet** → Select **Properties**
4. Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)**
5. Select **Use the following IP address** and fill in:
   - **IP address:** `192.168.50.1`
   - **Subnet mask:** `255.255.255.0`
   - **Default gateway:** (leave blank)
   - **DNS:** (leave empty)
6. Click **OK** → **Close**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}
**macOS (Ventura / Sonoma)**

1. Open **System Settings** → **Network** → Select **Ethernet**
   - If missing: click **+** → **Ethernet**
2. Click **Details** → **TCP/IP**
3. Set:
   - **Configure IPv4:** Manually
   - **IP Address:** `192.168.50.1`
   - **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
   - **Router:** (leave blank)
4. Click **OK**
5. *(Optional)* Go to **Details** → **DNS** and remove any DNS servers to prevent Ethernet from affecting your internet connection
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ubuntu" %}
**Ubuntu (GNOME)**

1. Click the top-right system menu → **Wired** → **Wired Settings**
   - Or: **Settings** → **Network** → **Wired**
2. Click the ⚙️ gear icon next to **Wired**
3. Go to the **IPv4** tab and set:
   - **Method:** Manual
   - **Address:** `192.168.50.1`
   - **Netmask:** `255.255.255.0`
   - **Gateway:** (leave empty)
   - **DNS:** (leave empty)
4. Click **Apply**
5. Toggle **Wired** OFF → ON to apply changes
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Via USB-C (Last Resort)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**USB-C connection is not recommended.** You need to unplug an internal cable to use this method. Only use this as a last resort when WiFi and Ethernet are not available.
{% endhint %}

<details>
<summary>Show USB-C connection instructions</summary>

If WiFi and Ethernet are unavailable, you can connect directly to the Jetson's USB-C port.

1. Connect a USB-C cable between your computer and the Jetson's USB-C port on MARS.
2. The Jetson exposes a network interface over USB-C at a fixed IP address.
3. SSH into the robot:

```bash
ssh jetson1@192.168.55.1
```

This method is useful when:

- The robot is not yet configured for WiFi
- Ethernet is not available
- You're debugging network issues as a last resort

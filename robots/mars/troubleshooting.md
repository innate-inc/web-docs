# Troubleshooting

This page explains how to diagnose issues on your MARS robot by inspecting the running processes.

---

## Connect via SSH

First, [SSH into your robot](connecting-via-ssh.md).

---

## Access the OS tmux session

MARS runs its software stack inside a `tmux` session. To attach to it:

```bash
tmux attach
```

If there are multiple sessions, you can list them with `tmux ls` and attach to the correct one.

---

## Navigate tmux to find issues

:::note
This section is for advanced users familiar with ROS2. If you're not comfortable with ROS, simply reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KtkyT97kc7) and we'll help you diagnose the issue.
:::

Once inside the tmux session, you'll see multiple windows or panes, each running a different ROS2 node or process.

### Basic tmux navigation

- **Switch windows:** `Ctrl+b` then `n` (next) or `p` (previous)
- **List windows:** `Ctrl+b` then `w`
- **Switch panes:** `Ctrl+b` then arrow keys
- **Scroll up:** `Ctrl+b` then `[`, then use arrow keys or Page Up/Down. Press `q` to exit scroll mode.

### Finding a problematic node

1. Cycle through the windows and panes to see which processes are running.
2. Look for error messages, stack traces, or nodes that have crashed or are restarting.
3. Use scroll mode to review recent output and identify what went wrong.

## Common Hardware Issues

### Arm Goes Limp / Servos Not Holding Position

If the arm loses tension and goes limp (servos not holding their position), this is typically a servo communication issue that can be resolved by rebooting the arm:

**Option 1: Reboot via the App (Recommended)**

1. Open the Innate Controller App
2. Go to **Configuration**
3. Select the **Dev** tab
4. Tap **Reboot Arm**

> **Note:** Place the arm in a resting position before rebooting. The app will display an image showing the correct arm position.

**Option 2: Full Robot Restart**

1. Unplug the robot's power
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Plug it back in

The arm should regain tension and hold position after either of these steps.

### Arm Restart Notifications

If the arm encounters an issue during operation (such as a servo communication failure), the app will display a notification prompting you to restart the arm. Follow the notification instructions to recover.

### Arm Overload Protection

MARS monitors the arm's servo load in real-time. If the arm is overloaded (e.g., carrying too heavy of an object or encountering an obstruction), the system will detect this and may reduce torque to protect the servos. If you notice reduced arm performance:

1. Remove any heavy objects from the gripper
2. Clear any obstructions
3. Reboot the arm via the app if needed

### iOS Arm Control

{% hint style="warning" %}
**iOS Users:** The leader arm connects via USB-C and is not compatible with iOS devices (for now). If you have an iPhone, please reach out to Innate on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KtkyT97kc7) to get access to a free Android phone for leader arm teleoperation.
{% endhint %}

## Low Battery Warning

The app displays a pulsing **Battery Low** warning when the robot's battery voltage drops below 10.53V. When you see this warning:

1. Stop any active tasks
2. Navigate the robot to its charging station
3. Connect the charger

Avoid running system updates or intensive operations when the battery is low.

# Overview

MARS is a small mobile manipulator packing all of the hardware and AI required to run a complete AI Robot. It is designed for hobbyists wanting to develop and share physical applications developed on it.



MARS is open-source, so that you can quickly modify it or develop your own stack on top of it.



You can buy a MARS from [our website](https://innate.bot/).

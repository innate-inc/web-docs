# Control via app & leader arm

MARS (and all Innate robots) are controllable via our app available <i class="fa-google-play">:google-play:</i> [here for android](https://innate.bot/android_app) and <i class="fa-app-store-ios">:app-store-ios:</i> [here for ios](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YeChe4A7).



Every MARS robot comes with a leader arm attachable to your phone in this way:

The app will automatically recognize your arm. Pressing the red "Arm" button allows to control the robot with the leader arm. For the best experience we recommend placing yourself behind the robot. If the connection is choppy, you can connect to your robot using your phone hotspot. You can see more details in [innate-controller-app](../innate-controller-app/ "mention").

{% hint style="warning" %}
**iOS Users:** The leader arm connects via USB-C and is not compatible with iOS devices. If you have an iPhone, reach out to Innate on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KtkyT97kc7) to get access to a free Android phone for leader arm teleoperation.

## Mapping Your Space

Before autonomous navigation, you'll want to map your environment. During mapping:

- **Arm Position** — Keep the arm in a safe resting position to avoid affecting sensor readings
- **Camera** — Ensure the camera has a clear view; avoid obstructing it during mapping
- **Speed** — Drive slowly and steadily for the best map quality
- **Coverage** — Cover each room thoroughly, including corners and doorways

The app provides hints and guidance during the mapping process to help you create a quality map.

# Control via app & leader arm

MARS (and all Innate robots) are controllable via our app available <i class="fa-google-play">:google-play:</i> [here for android](https://innate.bot/android_app) and <i class="fa-app-store-ios">:app-store-ios:</i> [here for ios](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YeChe4A7).



Every MARS robot comes with a leader arm attachable to your phone in this way:

The app will automatically recognize your arm. Pressing the red "Arm" button allows to control the robot with the leader arm. For the best experience we recommend placing yourself behind the robot. If the connection is choppy, you can connect to your robot using your phone hostpot. You can see more details in [innate-controller-app](../innate-controller-app/ "mention").&#x20;

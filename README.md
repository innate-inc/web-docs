Welcome to Innate!

We are developing **teachable, accessible general-purpose robots** for builders ranging from software engineers beginning in robotics, to advanced hardcore roboticists. The world of robotics is changing, and with our platforms, you can **quickly begin training your robot and developing applications**!



We currently offer:

* A small-size, affordable mobile manipulator (with onboard compute and a data collector) called Maurice for $3,000. You can book one here.
* The Innate SDK to quickly teach your robot new physical, digital tasks, and chain them in your home to perform long-term activities.



Follow us on Discord! \
We'll be posting more frequent updates and organize events there.

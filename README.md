At Innate, we make **affordable & intuitive AI robots** that you can teach and program.

Our whole stack, from the hardware to the software, is designed to run the state-of-the-art of AI in embodied agents and manipulation models.



This documentation describes our robots, our open operating system, how to develop with it, and examples of what you can do with them.



Our systems are developed with a few principles in mind:

* Users should be able to quickly run programs developed for our robots.
* Developers should have access to a complete powerful stack.
* The robots should be robust, reliable and precise to execute AI algorithms.

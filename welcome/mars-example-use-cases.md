# MARS Example use-cases

As an extensible general-purpose robot, MARS can be used for a wide array of use-cases, which can be further increased with additional sensors and effectors.

All the examples below are possible autonomously — some of them might require more data than we have collected so far.



* <i class="fa-briefcase-blank">:briefcase-blank:</i> A Desk Personal Productivity companion that hits you whenever you look at your phone or when it sees you are not working on your screen.
* <i class="fa-person-cane">:person-cane:</i> An Elderly Companion that takes notes during the day of what your grand-parents do and can remind them to take their medicine.&#x20;
* <i class="fa-trash">:trash:</i> A floor decluttering robot that takes legos and trash off the floor and in a particular bin in another room.
* <i class="fa-chess">:chess:</i> A Chess Playing Robot that roasts you while you play (or adopts a different character depending on the user).
* <i class="fa-shield-quartered">:shield-quartered:</i> A Security Robot that can open doors and explore the place, and call 911 if it sees someone.
* <i class="fa-martini-glass-citrus">:martini-glass-citrus:</i> A food serving robot that can put food in your plate when you show one in front of it.
* <i class="fa-bell-concierge">:bell-concierge:</i> A concierge robot that gives indication to visitors, flyers, and drives them to destination.<br>

# Frequently Asked Questions

We regularly get some questions asked, here is a compilation of answers:

### Can everything really run on the robot without a computer with GPU?

Yes!

We take great care to make sure your robot can be run everywhere without the need for a clunky setup. Our VLA (Innate ACT) and the SLAM, and the BASIC agent, all run on the robot (with the help of the cloud for BASIC).

A computer is required to develop for it, but once you're happy with your programs, you can close it.

Note that training the model (after collecting data) can be done on your computer OR on the cloud, in our infrastructure.

# Community Tutorials & Updates

MARS is designed to be hackable and extensible, and we're building a community of creators who are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with their robots.

## Community Tutorials

We regularly publish tutorials created by both the Innate team and MARS owners showcasing creative use cases, integrations, and tips. These tutorials cover a wide range of topics:

- **Home automation** — Integrating MARS with smart home systems
- **Custom skills** — Building and training your own manipulation skills
- **Creative applications** — Unique ways community members are using their robots
- **Hardware modifications** — Extending MARS with additional sensors and tools
- **AI integrations** — Connecting MARS to various AI services and models

Check back here regularly as we'll be adding new tutorials from the community.

# Navigation Interfaces

The `MobilityInterface` gives you direct control over the robot base—rotation, velocity commands, and movement. Use it for custom navigation behaviors that complement the built-in navigation.

## Core Navigation (Built-in)

The robot comes with built-in navigation that the agent calls *innately*. You don't need to implement this—it works out of the box.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Do not modify** the core `navigate_to_position` skill. It's a system-level skill that the agent uses automatically. Modifying it could break navigation behavior.
{% endhint %}

When you tell the robot "go to the kitchen," the agent automatically:
1. Translates "kitchen" to map coordinates (if the location is saved)
2. Calls the built-in navigation skill
3. Monitors progress and handles obstacles

## MobilityInterface

Declare the interface at class level:

```python
from brain_client.skill_types import Skill, Interface, InterfaceType

class MySkill(Skill):
    mobility = Interface(InterfaceType.MOBILITY)
```

### Methods

| Method | Parameters | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `rotate()` | `angle_radians: float` | Rotate in place (blocking, uses Nav2) |
| `send_cmd_vel()` | `linear_x, angular_z, duration` | Publish velocity (non-blocking) |
| `rotate_in_place()` | `angular_speed, duration` | Rotate at speed for duration |

### Examples

```python
import math

# Rotate 90 degrees (blocking)
self.mobility.rotate(math.pi / 2)

# Drive forward for 2 seconds (non-blocking)
self.mobility.send_cmd_vel(linear_x=0.1, angular_z=0.0, duration=2.0)

# Spin in place
self.mobility.rotate_in_place(angular_speed=0.5, duration=3.0)
```

## When to Use

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Go to a saved location | Use built-in (agent handles it) |
| Survey surroundings | Create custom skill with `rotate()` |
| Follow a person | Create custom skill with `send_cmd_vel()` |
| Fine positioning for manipulation | Create custom skill |
| Patrol a route | Create custom skill |

## Example: LookAround

A skill that rotates to survey the environment:

```python
from brain_client.skill_types import Skill, SkillResult, Interface, InterfaceType
import math

class LookAround(Skill):
    mobility = Interface(InterfaceType.MOBILITY)

    @property
    def name(self):
        return "look_around"

    def guidelines(self):
        return "Use when the robot needs to look in multiple directions."

    def execute(self, num_directions: int = 4):
        rotation_per_step = (2 * math.pi) / num_directions

        for i in range(num_directions):
            if self._cancelled:
                return "Survey cancelled", SkillResult.CANCELLED

            self._send_feedback(f"Looking direction {i+1}/{num_directions}")
            self.mobility.rotate(rotation_per_step)

        return "Survey complete", SkillResult.SUCCESS

    def cancel(self):
        self._cancelled = True
        return "Survey cancelled"
```

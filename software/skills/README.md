# Skills

Skills are atomic robot capabilities that BASIC chains together to accomplish complex, long-horizon behaviors. Each skill encodes a single capability—physical (manipulation, navigation) or digital (emails, API calls)—that can be combined with others to form coherent action sequences.

When BASIC receives a request like "check on grandma," it decomposes this into a skill chain: navigate to bedroom → look around → send picture via email → speak reassurance. Four skills, one coherent behavior.

## Two Types of Skills

Skills are defined in one of two ways:

### Code-Defined Skills

Python classes that implement explicit logic. The AI agent reads your code's function signature and docstrings to understand what the skill does and how to call it.

```python
class LookAround(Skill):
    mobility = Interface(InterfaceType.MOBILITY)
    head = Interface(InterfaceType.HEAD)

    def execute(self):
        """Rotate and scan the environment."""
        self.head.set_position(-15)  # Look down
        self.mobility.rotate(math.pi)  # Turn 180°
        ...
```

Use code-defined skills for:
- **Physical behaviors** — Direct control of base, arm, and head
- **Digital operations** — Emails, API calls, web services
- **Coordinated behaviors** — Sequencing multiple actions with explicit logic
- **Sensor processing** — Vision, scanning, object detection

### Policy-Defined Skills (End-to-End)

Neural network policies trained from demonstration. Currently uses **ACT (Action Chunking with Transformers)** for manipulation tasks.

```json
{
    "name": "pick_cup",
    "type": "learned",
    "guidelines": "Use when you need to pick up a cup",
    "execution": {
        "model_type": "act_policy",
        "checkpoint": "policy_step_50000.pth"
    }
}
```

Use policy-defined skills for:
- **Manipulation** — Picking, placing, grasping objects
- **Tasks requiring visual adaptation** — The policy reacts to what it sees
- **Behaviors hard to express in code** — Complex motions learned from demonstration

See [Policy-Defined Skills](policy-defined-skills.md) for details on creating and training learned skills.

## Skill Directories

Skills are auto-discovered from two directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `~/skills/` | **Your skills** — put custom skills here |
| `innate-os/skills/` | **Built-in skills** — templates and examples, don't modify |

| Skill Type | Format |
|------------|--------|
| Code-defined | `*.py` — Python class extending `Skill` |
| Policy-defined | `<name>/metadata.json` — JSON metadata + model checkpoint |

No registration required. Drop a file in the right place and the robot loads it on startup.

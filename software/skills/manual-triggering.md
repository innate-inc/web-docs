# Manual Triggering

You can trigger skills manually through the Innate Controller App, bypassing the AI agent. This is useful for testing, debugging, or directly controlling the robot.

## Using the Skills Tab for Code-Defined Skills

1. Open the **Innate Controller App**
2. Navigate to the **Skills** tab -> Digital Skills.
3. Select a skill then press **Execute**

The robot will execute the skill without going through the agent's reasoning loop.

For skills that take parameters, the app shows input fields for each argument.

## Directly in Manual Control for Policy-Defined Skills

1. Go to the **Home** tab
2. Press **Manual**
3. Select a skill in the dropdown then press the ▶️ button.

The robot will execute the skill without going through the agent's reasoning loop.

## When to Use Manual Triggering

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Testing** | Verify a skill works before deploying |
| **Debugging** | Isolate skill behavior from agent logic |
| **Direct control** | Run a specific action without voice/chat |
| **Demos** | Trigger skills on demand during presentations |

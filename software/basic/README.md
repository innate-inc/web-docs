# BASIC

**BASIC** is our embodied agent, named in tribute to the BASIC languages that hobbyists used in the early age of PCs.

You can think of BASIC as the agentic AI running your behaviors and skills. When running, BASIC controls the robot autonomously following your instructions.



## Technical Report

**TBD**

**BASIC** is evaluated and improved in a 3d simulation in which we test its ability to perform a wide array of tasks. More to be revealed soon...

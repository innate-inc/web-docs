# BASIC

**BASIC** is our embodied agent, named in tribute to the BASIC languages that hobbyists used in the early age of PCs. Think of it as the LLM OS running your behaviors and skills. When running, BASIC controls the robot autonomously following your instructions.



BASIC is a complex assembly of several models, giving the impression you're interacting with one model with ability to memorize and plan spatially.



## Technical Report

**TBD**

**BASIC** is evaluated and improved in a 3d simulation in which we test its ability to perform a wide array of tasks. More to be revealed soon.

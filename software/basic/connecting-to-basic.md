# Connecting to BASIC

BASIC is accessible for free to all users of Innate robots for 300 cumulative hours - and probably more if you ask us.

---

## How it works

BASIC runs in the cloud at `brain.innate.bot`. Your MARS robot connects to it automatically via websockets using Innate's protocol.

The connection is handled by the `brain_client_node` in the Innate OS. You don't need to configure anything manually—MARS connects to BASIC on startup.

## Authentication

Each MARS robot is given a unique **token ID** that authenticates it with BASIC. This token is stored in the `.env` file on your robot.

If you've accidentally deleted your token or need to retrieve it, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KtkyT97kc7) or [via email](mailto:axel@innate.bot) and we'll provide it.

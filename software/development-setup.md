# Development Setup

There are several ways to develop for MARS. This page covers the different approaches and their trade-offs.

## Recommended: VSCode-based IDE with SSH

The recommended approach is to use a **VSCode-based IDE** with remote SSH capabilities. This allows you to:

- Edit code directly on the robot with full IDE features
- Use AI-assisted coding tools
- Access the robot's file system seamlessly
- Run and debug code in the robot's environment

### Compatible IDEs

Several VSCode forks work well for MARS development:

- **Cursor** - AI-first code editor with powerful autocomplete
- **Windsurf** - AI-powered IDE by Codeium
- **Antigravity** - Another AI-enhanced VSCode fork
- **VSCode** - The original, with the Remote SSH extension

All of these support the **Remote - SSH** extension (or have it built-in), which lets you connect to MARS and develop as if the files were local.

### Connecting via SSH

1. **Install the Remote - SSH extension** (if using vanilla VSCode)

2. **Open the Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)

3. **Select** `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...`

4. **Enter the SSH connection string** using the credentials and IP from the [Connecting via SSH](../robots/mars/connecting-via-ssh.md) page

5. **Open the workspace folder** once connected (e.g., `/home/jetson1/innate-ws/`)

For default credentials, IP addresses, and connection methods (WiFi vs USB-C), see [Connecting via SSH](../robots/mars/connecting-via-ssh.md).
{% endhint %}

### Tips for SSH Development

- **Set up SSH keys** to avoid entering the password repeatedly
- **Keep the connection alive** by configuring `ServerAliveInterval` in your `~/.ssh/config`
- **Use the integrated terminal** to run ROS2 commands and test agents directly

## Alternative: Local Development with Deployment

You can also develop locally on your machine and deploy to MARS:

1. Write and test code locally
2. Copy files to the robot via `scp` or `rsync`
3. SSH into the robot to run and test

This approach is useful when:

- You have limited or unreliable network connectivity
- You prefer your local development environment
- You're working on code that doesn't require robot hardware for initial testing

## Direct SSH Terminal

For quick edits or debugging, you can SSH directly into MARS using terminal-based editors like `nano` or `vim`. See [Connecting via SSH](../robots/mars/connecting-via-ssh.md) for connection details.

This is best for:

- Quick configuration changes
- Viewing logs
- Running diagnostic commands

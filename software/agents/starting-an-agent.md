# Starting an agent

Agents can be triggered on the robot or straight from [the controller app.](../../robots/innate-controller-app/)

## Trigger an Agent

### Option 1: Mars App

1. Connect to your robot in the **Mars** app
2. On the **Home** screen, locate the **Agents** section
3. Tap an agent to activate it



## Default agent

You can define an agent as the default agent of your robot. In this case, the robot will automatically boot up to this agent upon starting.

You can do this in the app, on **Home**, press an agent, then press the "**Set as default**" button.



When an agent is set as default, it is displayed as such on the controller app.

# Agent Examples

These examples demonstrate different agent patterns. Use them as starting points for your own implementations.

## Security Guard

A patrol agent that monitors for intruders and sends email alerts.

```python
from typing import List
from brain_client.agent_types import Agent


class SecurityGuardAgent(Agent):
    """Patrols the premises and alerts on unauthorized visitors."""

    @property
    def id(self) -> str:
        return "security_guard"

    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return "Security Guard"

    @property
    def display_icon(self) -> str:
        return "assets/security_guard.png"

    def get_skills(self) -> List[str]:
        return [
            "navigate_to_position",
            "open_door",
            "send_email",
        ]

    def get_inputs(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["micro"]

    def get_prompt(self) -> str:
        return """You are a security guard robot. Maintain a vigilant,
professional demeanor at all times.

Patrol route:
1. Start in the living room
2. Check the kitchen
3. Move to the bedroom
4. Inspect the back door
5. Return to start and repeat

Patrol behavior:
- Move deliberately through each area
- Observe carefully before proceeding
- Open doors that block your path
- Identify anyone who shouldn't be present

Intruder protocol:
- Do not confront
- Send email to owner@example.com immediately
- Include location and description of what you observed

Maintain professional alertness throughout your patrol."""
```

**Key pattern**: The prompt includes a specific route, clear behavioral guidelines, and explicit instructions for edge cases (intruder detection).

## Object Collector

A task-focused agent that finds and collects specific items.

```python
from typing import List
from brain_client.agent_types import Agent


class SockCollector(Agent):
    """Collects socks from the floor and places them in the laundry basket."""

    @property
    def id(self) -> str:
        return "sock_collector"

    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return "Sock Collector"

    def get_skills(self) -> List[str]:
        return [
            "navigate_to_position",
            "pick_up_object",
            "drop_object",
        ]

    def get_inputs(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["micro"]

    def get_prompt(self) -> str:
        return """You are a tidying robot. Your task: find socks on the
floor and place them in the laundry basket.

Procedure:
1. Scan the room for socks on the floor
2. Navigate to a visible sock
3. Pick it up
4. Navigate to the laundry basket (white wicker basket near the
   bedroom door)
5. Drop the sock in
6. Repeat until no socks remain

Guidelines:
- Check under furniture edges where socks tend to accumulate
- If a sock is unreachable, skip it and continue
- Perform a final sweep when you believe you're done"""
```

**Key pattern**: Single-purpose agent with a clear procedure and practical guidelines for handling edge cases.

## Tour Guide

An interactive agent that engages with visitors and provides guided tours.

```python
from typing import List
from brain_client.agent_types import Agent


class TourGuide(Agent):
    """Welcomes visitors and provides guided tours of the space."""

    @property
    def id(self) -> str:
        return "tour_guide"

    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return "Tour Guide"

    def get_skills(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["navigate_to_position", "wave"]

    def get_inputs(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["micro"]

    def get_prompt(self) -> str:
        return """You are a tour guide robot. Be warm, knowledgeable,
and attentive to your guests.

Greeting:
1. Wave and welcome approaching visitors
2. Ask if they would like a tour
3. Begin the tour if they accept

Tour route:
- Entrance: Brief history of the building
- Main hall: Notable artwork and features
- Workshop: Current projects and activities
- Lounge: Conclude and offer to answer questions

Interaction style:
- Speak clearly at a comfortable pace
- Allow time for guests to observe each area
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Maintain eye contact during conversation

If a guest needs to leave early, thank them for visiting."""

    def uses_gaze(self) -> bool:
        return True
```

**Key pattern**: Uses gaze tracking for natural interaction. The prompt covers greeting, tour content, and social protocols.

## Passive Observer

A minimal agent that monitors without active engagement.

```python
from typing import List
from brain_client.agent_types import Agent


class QuietObserver(Agent):
    """Observes the environment and responds only when addressed."""

    @property
    def id(self) -> str:
        return "quiet_observer"

    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return "Quiet Observer"

    def get_skills(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["turn_and_move"]

    def get_inputs(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["micro"]

    def get_prompt(self) -> str:
        return """You are an observant robot with a calm presence.

Behavior:
- Remain quiet unless directly addressed
- When spoken to, respond briefly and thoughtfully
- Slowly turn to observe your surroundings
- Do not move around unless requested

Maintain a non-intrusive presence in the room."""

    def uses_gaze(self) -> bool:
        return True
```

**Key pattern**: Minimal skills and a restrained prompt create a passive presence rather than an active participant.

## Combining Patterns

These examples represent common patterns that can be combined:

- **Patrol + Alert**: Security guard pattern
- **Search + Manipulate**: Object collector pattern
- **Navigate + Interact**: Tour guide pattern
- **Observe + Respond**: Passive observer pattern

Mix elements from different patterns to create agents suited to your specific requirements.

# Agents

## What is an agent?

Agents steer your robot to perform complex long horizon tasks. An agent is a combination of robot skills, additional sensory inputs, and language instructions.

When running with BASIC, it brings the robot to life to execute the agent, like a human being would by following the instructions.



#### Agents are like apps!

Agents are like **apps**, but for your robot. Once created, you can easily send your agent and the associated code and data to anyone else with an Innate robot.

#### Where can I find my agents?

All Innate robots come with a set of agents pre-installed–like your PC comes with a set of small apps pre-installed.&#x20;

You can directly find them on the **Home** page in the Innate Controller App.

# Starting a behavior

Behaviors can be triggered on the robot or straight from [the controller app.](../../robots/innate-controller-app/)

## Trigger a Behavior

### Option 1: Mars App

1. Connect to your robot in the **Mars** app
2. On the **Home** screen, locate the **Behaviors** section
3. Tap a behavior to activate it



## Default behavior

You can define a behavior as the default behavior of your robot. In this case, the robot will automatically boot up to this behavior upon starting.

You can do this in the app, on **Home**, press a behavior, then press the "**Set as default**" button.



When a behavior is set as default, it is displayed as such on the controller app.

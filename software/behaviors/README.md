# Behaviors

## What is a behavior?

Behaviors steer your robot to perform complex long horizon tasks. A behavior is a combination of robot skills, additional sensory inputs, and language instructions.

When running with BASIC, it brings the robot to life to execute the behavior, like a human being would by following the instructions.



#### Behaviors are like apps!

Behaviors are like **apps**, but for your robot. Once created, you can easily send your behavior and the associated code and data to anyone else with an Innate robot.

#### Where can I find my behaviors?

All Innate robots come with a set of behaviors pre-installedâ€“like your PC comes with a set of small apps pre-installed.&#x20;

You can directly find them on the **Home** page in the Innate Controller App.

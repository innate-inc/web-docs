# Skills

Skills are atomic robot capabilities that are combined and chained by BASIC to enable complex long horizon behaviors. Skills can code for physical capabilities ( Manipulation, Navigation etc), digital capabilities (emails, data processing, API calls) or both.

Defining a skill requires three main components which BASIC can interact with

1. Guidelines: Provides BASIC with language instruction for when and how to use the capabilities encoded in the Skill
2. Execution: Provides a method for BASIC to call to execute the capability encoded
3. Cancellation: Provides a method for BASIC safely and reactively cancel execution when appropriate.

## Defining Skills

Below is a sample skill.

```python
from innate.skill import Skill
from typing import Tuple

class MySkill(Skill):
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the skill
        """
        super().__init__()  # Required: initialize parent class

    def guidelines(self) -> str:
        """
        Define usage guidelines for when this skill should be used
        Returns: string describing use cases and restrictions
        """
        return """
        Use this skill when:
        - [Describe when to use this skill]
        - [List relevant conditions]

        Do not use when:
        - [Describe when not to use this skill]
        - [List restrictions or limitations]
        """

    def execute(self) -> Tuple[str, bool]:
        """
        Main execution logic
        Returns: (feedback string, success boolean)
        """
        try:
            # Implement your skillâ€™s logic here
            return "Task completed successfully", True
        except:
            return "Task failed", False

    def interrupt(self):
        """
        Define how to safely stop execution
        """
        # Implement safe stopping behavior here

```

    def execute(self) -> Tuple[str, bool]:
